In the provided example, the "Services" page of the hospital 
website was made responsive through a combination of HTML and
 CSS techniques, particularly media queries. Here's how the 
 page became responsive:

1. Fluid Grid Layout:
   - A responsive design starts with a flexible grid layout.
    The original layout for service cards utilized the `flexbox` 
    model to arrange them side by side. This flexible grid allows
     elements to adapt to different screen widths.

2. Media Queries:
   - Media queries are the core of responsive design. 
     They are conditional statements in CSS that apply specific
    styles based on the characteristics of the user's device,
    such as screen width.
   - In the provided CSS file, there is a media query:

     css
     @media screen and (max-width: 768px) {
          CSS rules for screens with a width of 768px or less go 
          here 
        }
    
   
      - Inside the media query, we applied specific styles to elements,
       allowing the layout to change when the screen width is 768 pixels
        or less.
   
   3. Responsive Typography:
      - The font sizes were adjusted in the media query to ensure
       that the text remains readable on smaller screens. 
       This prevents text from becoming too small or too large,
        improving the overall mobile experience.
   
   4. Stacking Service Cards:
      - In the media query, the service cards were set to `display: block`, 
      which stacks them vertically on smaller screens. This ensures that the
       cards are easy to read and interact with on mobile devices.
   
   5. Adjusted Contact Form:
      - The contact form's maximum width was reduced to 90% to
       fit smaller screens better. It ensures that the form fields
        and button remain within the screen width and are easy to
         use.
   
   6. Mobile Map Size:
      - The map's height was reduced in the media query to 250px,
       ensuring that it doesn't dominate the screen on mobile devices. This prevents the need for excessive scrolling and ensures that the map remains fully visible.
   
   In summary, responsiveness was achieved through the use of 
   media queries that conditionally modified the layout and styling
   of elements based on the screen's width. By stacking service 
   cards, adjusting form width, and optimizing font sizes,
    the "Services" page was made more user-friendly and accessible
     on mobile screens, providing a better user experience for
      visitors accessing the site on different devices.

 Making an image responsive involves using CSS to ensure the image adjusts its size based on the screen size or the size of its container. Here are the steps to make an image responsive:

1. **HTML Structure:**
   Start with your HTML structure. Place the `<img>` tag inside a container, such as a `<div>` element. For example:

   ```html
   <div class="image-container">
       <img src="your-image.jpg" alt="Description of the image">
   </div>
   ```

2. **CSS Styling:**
   Apply CSS styles to the image and its container to make it responsive. Use the following CSS rules:

   ```css
   .image-container {
       max-width: 100%; /* Set the maximum width of the container to 100% of its parent element */
       height: auto; /* Maintain the aspect ratio of the image */
       width: auto\9; /* IE8 support */
   }

   .image-container img {
       width: 100%; /* Set the width of the image to 100% of its parent element (the container) */
       height: auto; /* Maintain the aspect ratio of the image */
   }
   ```

   Explanation:
   - `max-width: 100%;` ensures the container does not exceed the width of its parent element.
   - `height: auto;` maintains the image's aspect ratio, preventing distortion.
   - `width: 100%;` makes the image fill the width of its container.

3. **Testing:**
   Test your responsive image by resizing the browser window or viewing it on different devices (such as smartphones and tablets). The image should adjust its size proportionally based on the screen size.

By following these steps and applying the specified CSS styles, you create a responsive image that adapts to various screen sizes, providing a better user experience across different devices.
